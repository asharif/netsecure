depends on gomail @ https://github.com/asharif/gomail to be compiled and in same dir
depends on nmap @ http://nmap.org/

this app is a simple network monitoring utility to notify you when unknown mac addresses jump onto your LAN.  it uses nmap so that needs to be installed

here is how to use:

1.  build gomail and place in same dir
2.  modify email-alert.sh to use a smtp server that u want
3.  modify known-mac-addr file to include all known mac addresses on your LAN.  the app looks for \n or "new line" for seperator
4.  if you need to modify nmap-run.sh to look on diff subnet...default is 192.168.1.0/24
5.  add crontab entry to run as often as desired

example crontab entry
*  *    * * *   root    (cd /opt/netsecure/; ./netsecure) > /dev/null
